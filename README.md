# ENG224 Electrical Machines and Power Systems

Unit covers the theory and practice of electrical machines and power systems as used in electrical engineering.

The following topics are covered on electrical machines:
* review magnetic circuits & materials;
* coupled circuits and dot convention;
* the principle of electromechanical energy conversion;
* transformers;
* direct current machines;
* synchronous machines;
* induction machines;
* the basic structure of a power system;
* electric power generation; and
* single and three phase systems.

The following topics are covered on power systems:
* three phase transformers;
* switch gear and protection equipment;
* voltage drop;
* power factor correction;
* earthing;
* protection equipment ratings; and
* per-unit system.
